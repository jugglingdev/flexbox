### What I learned

This tutorial covered how to use Flexbox to define alignment, direction, order, and size of boxes by styling flex containers and their children, flex items.

For horizontal alignment, I learned that the `justify-content` property can take values of `center`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `space-around`, or `space-between`.  

Vertical alignment, on the other hand, uses the `align-items` property with values of `center`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `stretch`, or `baseline`.



Code snippets from this exercise include:

```css
/* This is the same as `margin: 0 auto` */
.some-container {
  justify-content: center;
}
```
